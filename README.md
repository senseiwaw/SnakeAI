Machine Learning Model playing Snake & Graphical Interface using Arcade
- **Architecture of the model**
- *Neural Networks*
- *Bellman Equation*
- *Optimization with Forward and Backward Propagation*

- **Arcade**

2 different achitecture trained by **reinforcement learning**

V1) *Partially observable Markov decision process*
- *input = local directions*
- *experience replay*

V2) *Markov decision process*
- *input = the entire grid*

Why Gemini 3 Pro (le goattt) will be used to make progress towards the goal : a tool useful to provide guidance for a *beginner* like me.

.md files contains Q&A showing each step towards the goal.
