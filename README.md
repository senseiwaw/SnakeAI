I'm learning how to make and train a reinforcement learning using basic python (mainly numpy).

My initial idea was to learn basics of ML without taking any specific classes since I already have studied math at the level required to follow this : https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/02/19/a-long-peek-into-reinforcement-learning.html
So my only instructors in this learning project is : Gemini 3 Pro

I chose do it like that in order to get my hands dirty. For most courses in ML on Coursera are passive learning not active !
While, using Gemini 3 Pro is much more fun for me, it's like a GUIDE !
Since it's my first project he helped me started with my goal of solving snake from scratch without using any module except numpy.
You can find the different steps I go through in the file : Projet_SnakeAI_with_Numpy.py


I find this repo very useful for me to track my progess. Each time I ask Gemini for a new feature in my project, I implement it and add the file in this repo.
Thus, when you want to look at a specific feature of the project you can open the corresponding function in the repo.

Basically : snakeAI.py contains the whole file BUT the other python files are slices of snakeAI.py which help understanding each features of the model separately. Plus these slices of codes are much more explained and documented than in snakeAI.py to improve readability and understandability.

There might be lots of mistakes which I would be very sorry of ! It's very expermiental for the moment, and I may include my own thoughts, I'm open to any recommendation, don't hesitate to share !
In terms of the language it's a mix of french and english even if I try to write only in english !
