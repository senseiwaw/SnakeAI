My 1st project : Reinforcement ML Model using `pytorch` & Graphical Interface using `arcade`

- **Architecture of the model**
  - Deep Q Network
  - Neural Networks
  - Bellman Equation
  - Optimization with Forward and Backward Propagation

- **Arcade games**
  - Snake
  - Pong

Comparaison between architectures trained by **reinforcement learning** : *feature* based RL & *pixel*-based RL

- *feature*
  
  *Partially observable Markov decision process*
    - *input = local vision*
    - *experience replay*

  *Markov decision process*
    - *input* = the grid represented as a matrix containing specified objects
    - Deep Neural Networks (2 layers)

- *pixel*

  *CNN*
    - *input* = the grid represented as an image
    - Convolutional Neural Networks 

.md files contains Q&A showing each step towards the goal.
